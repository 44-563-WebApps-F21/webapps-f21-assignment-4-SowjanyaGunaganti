                    ACT III.  _The Library of Lord Goring’s House in Curzon Street_.

                       <h6>LORD GORING</h6>  <p>With pleasure</p>  <p>[_Puts her cloak on_.]</p>

<h6>MRS. CHEVELEY</h6>  <p>Thanks.  I am never going to try to harm Robert Chiltern
    again.</p>

<h6>LORD GORING</h6>  <p>Fortunately you have not the chance, Mrs. Cheveley.
</p>

<h6>MRS. CHEVELEY</h6> <p>Well, if even I had the chance, I wouldn’t.  On the
    contrary, I am going to render him a great service.
    </p> 

<h6>LORD GORING</h6>  <p>I am charmed to hear it.  It is a reformation.</p>

<h6>MRS. CHEVELEY</h6> <p>Yes.  I can’t bear so upright a gentleman, so honourable
    an English gentleman, being so shamefully deceived, and so—</p>

<h6>LORD GORING</h6>  <p>Well?</p>

<h6>MRS. CHEVELEY</h6>  <p>I find that somehow Gertrude Chiltern’s dying speech and
    confession has strayed into my pocket.</p>

<h6>LORD GORING</h6>  <p>What do you mean?</p>

<h6>MRS. CHEVELEY</h6> <p>[_With a bitter note of triumph in her voice_.]</p> <p>I mean 
    that I am going to send Robert Chiltern the love-letter his wife wrote to
    you to-night.</p>
